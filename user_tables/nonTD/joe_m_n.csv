If you're having intrusive thoughts that make you feel bad about yourself, try to dismiss them. Distract yourself if necessary. It takes practice, but it might make you feel better in the long run.","daddit",2,0,0,2019-05-05 12:52:56
"9","Not sure which of the many voting theorems the above poster is referring to, but here's a classic.
