"5","Tbh the way they wrote Lane off the show has always bothered me. First it would be such an uncharacteristic thing for Lane to do. Second, I’m almost certain if he had told the other partners the situation they could have accommodated him. At the very least he could have gone to Don, who would probably have loaned him the money (he covered Pete’s share of the cash call after Pete covered for him with the DoD work). 

Finally, why the hell would Lane be stressed about a UK tax bill when he lives in the US??? Obviously he would need to pay it at some point but he wasn’t about to get arrested. The worst the UK government would do is seize his British assets (if he had any). 

Yes I get that part of the point is that he was ashamed of his financial situation. But it all just felt so implausible.","madmen",4,0,0,2019-09-01 03:52:50
"6","NTA, BUT here’s a better way to handle his chronic lateness that doesn’t involve petty lying:

Make it clear to him that from now on, you are going to organize yourself to arrive at events when you want to. And he can do the same. You shower, get dressed, organize travel to arrive ten minutes early for things (if its your car, you drive and he figures out how to get there; if it’s his car, maybe you take an Uber/Lyft or transit if it’s feasible; if you have each have a car then you each drive yourself). And if he wants to roll in an hour late, that’s on him. He shouldn’t dictate your schedule or how much time you spend with the people that you’re going to see. 

You may be a couple, but you’re still your own person and are allowed to make your own decisions about this stuff.

Also let’s be clear, his line about “what else could you lie about?” was manipulative. He was trying to make you the bad guy. Sure, lying like you did isn’t the greatest, but it’s a very little thing, and he was making it a big thing in a way that also gave him the high road, when this all happened because he was being dismissive of your feelings and preferences. Manipulation and being dismissive of your feelings are two flags that I would keep an eye on.","AmItheAsshole",2,0,0,2019-08-31 22:17:19

"27","Actually I found it very realistic. Harry aspires to the status of Don and Roger, as does Pete. But Pete has the built-in advantage of his family and upbringing that tell him how people at that level of society are expected to act. So even though he has his stumbles, he was basically always going to get there. Don and Roger are almost always contemptuous of Pete, but Bert Cooper tells them early in the show that they’re going to have to make him part of the club because of who his family is.

Harry doesn’t have that same built-in privilege so as he rose in profile and influence, he tried his version of acting like Don and Roger, but in the clunkiest, most loutish way possible. (Don’s ability to so smoothly code switch from one world to the other is the outlier)

Ken is the tell to this. What distinguishes Ken from Harry is at some point he grasps what Don and Roger really are and decides that’s not who he wants to be. He trades his ambition for contentment and ends up happier for it.","madmen",6,0,0,2019-05-11 03:39:17

"42","The counterpoint to this is that getting up and running on a tour is really expensive. You need a long run to recoup the costs and generate cash flow. And Oceania tours chew through money because everything has to be moved by plane for comparatively few shows. That's why they've never started their tours there: It would dig them an enormous financial whole they'd spend the rest of the tour digging out of. (The shows barely break even as it is because there's so much stagecraft...the profit usually comes from the merch)

So in this case if they're re-using existing sets, that definitely limits the upfront costs. But in general, to do yearly mini-tours would be a total money pit. Obviously they can afford it, but I think they still prioritize making money off their work.","U2Band",2,0,0,2018-11-27 13:44:57

But this is one of many U2 songs that take on an entire other dimension live. The opening base line is maybe Adam’s best (obv NYD has a case), Larry’s drumming always elevates the intensity of the song, and Edge does all the right things in the right moments. 

The outro is mind-blowing every time. It builds through little riffs and then just explodes into power chords until it exhausts itself.

Bono tells of flying back to Dublin after shows and going right into the studio still wearing his Macphisto makeup. I love that the album gives you a sense of the energy of the tour. 

The album also owes part its existence in part to the breakup of Edge's first marriage. He was basically keeping himself busy in the studio and new songs kept turning up.

As an album, it's just about perfect. No bad songs, no song that sticks its neck above the others. Every song feels like it fits.

That's why she resents you trying to, you know, parent your own gd child. Because it gets in the way of her being an amazing grandma. 

I also recognize your husband's response to her behaviour. She has trained him (like my mother trained me) to always sympathize with her needs. Which is why he's able to talk about her trauma after she nearly killed his child.

My mother's entire family (my aunts, my half-sister) is narcissistic, and after my mom died 8 years ago I made the decision to cut all of them out of my life and I haven't regretted it for a day. 

All of which is to say I think you are completely right to cut her off. Not as revenge for almost killing your child, but because she has demonstrated she does not care about their health and safety. She can't be trusted to put them first. And she clearly has no respect for you, so you owe her nothing in terms of your own time and energy.

Again, the more you move into dealings with other cultures that don't have that luxury, the less you can rely on people's better angels. Bajor is perfectly set up in the show as an environment with huge scarcity issues.

I think the key takeaway from DS9 is that the progress depicted up to that point in the canon wasn't a result of some innate neural evolution in humans away from our more selfish and manipulative traits. It's presented as a cultural evolution, where widespread values push us away from our darker impulses. They haven't been eliminated.

Finally, I think it's worth remembering that Roddenberry could take his vision to unreasonable extremes. He was opposed to the Picard brothers feud story line in the ""Family"" episode because he thought people would have evolved beyond petty conflicts like that. That's a pretty pollyanna-esque attitude to even simple family dynamics.","DaystromInstitute",66,0,0,2017-04-27 00:23:51

"93","I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my mother suddenly seven years ago, I was five years older than you, and there's no way I would have had the wherewithal to handle the logistics that you've dealt with over the last few weeks. So, first and foremost, you and your brother are doing GREAT. Honestly, the stuff you're doing is stuff your aunts should have been dealing with. They should be looking after YOU.

Also, it sounds like it's very important to you that the service be perfect and beautiful. I'd really encourage you to let that go. I mean, the service will be beautiful in any case because it will be people speaking from the heart about this person you all love. But trying to choreograph everything so closely is just creating additional stress and pressure when you should be focusing on mourning together. 

It sounds like a lot of it is being driven by the minister. Asking to review speeches, setting time limits. If the person officiating my mother's funeral had acted this way, I would have told him to shove it. If people ramble a bit it's fine. If they repeat things other people have said, it's fine. People are very understanding of these types of things. Again, speaking from the heart about loss is seldom well choreographed. 

When we lose a loved one (whether our parents, siblings, or children) we grieve in very personal ways. And we tend to latch on to seemingly innocuous actions by others as deeply personal slights about our relationship with the person we've lost. So Sarah is coping with her loss and is magnifying your actions (editing the eulogy, not meeting her when she arrived, not hosting her at your home) as a commentary on how important she was to your mother. To be clear, IT IS NOT YOUR JOB TO MANAGE HER FEELINGS RIGHT NOW. You've got enough emotions of your own to be dealing with, and she's reacting in a very self-centred way. 

It probably wasn't necessary to ask her to edit her eulogy. But you are doing the best you can right now. And her reaction was totally out of proportion. 

You and your brother don't owe your aunts anything. I hear the frustration in your post, and it's valid and understandable. You're doing the best you can, and it's not right that in the midst of this, the two of you are in the position of trying to be the grown ups when dealing with your aunts. If they left it on you to organize logistics for the funeral, it's crap for them to turn around and make you feel bad for your choices.

But if you want to reach out to them and be the bigger people, remind them that you and your brother are doing the best you can, that you all love and miss your mother and should try to be understanding of everyone is experiencing. Don't go over every slight. You don't even need to apologize. Just say that you hope they can understand you're doing your best and don't mean to slight anyone's feelings. If they still can't get over themselves, then leave them be and focus on yourselves.

All the best. I hope you get some time to grieve properly soon.","relationships",10,0,0,2017-02-23 06:16:01

And secondly, and regardless of anything you had specifically negotiated, you used your safe word, which totally revokes all consent, and he ignored it. Non-consent=rape.

"131","Part of the population decline in Montreal, in addition to the typical exodus to the suburbs that most North American cities experienced during that time, is related to the FLQ/sovereigntist movement in Quebec. The rise of separatism prompted a significant exodus of anglophones from Montreal to Toronto and other cities in Canada. 

In addition to being made to feel unwelcome by the french nationalist movement, many companies had their corporate headquarters in Montreal but relocated to other cities in Canada, hurting the economy and employment opportunities in Montreal. There were concerns about some industries being nationalized as happened with the utility companies that were turned into Hydro Quebec.

The exodus began slowly in 1970 after the FLQ crisis (a terrorist separatist organization called the Front de Liberation du Quebec) where a cabinet minister and a British diplomat were kidnapped (the cabinet minister was killed), accelerated in 1976 when the separatist Parti Quebecois won a majority in the provincial legislature, and reached a peak in 1977 when Bill 101 was passed, imposing significant restrictions on the use of English for business in the province.

Meanwhile, Aaron Sanchez, Marco Estrada, and JA Happ have all posted Top 10 numbers in the American League this year (and no I'm not counting pitcher wins) and Marcus Stroman has been very good since July 1st. RA Dickey is the only weak spot in the Jays rotation. Happ and Estrada both had rough starts in Tampa, but otherwise have been consistently excellent.

"167","Wordy prologue to my comment:

Star Trek is a great platform for exploring something that fascinates me about humanity, which is the relationship between culture, technology, and economy. For example, I'm thoroughly fascinated by Japan because it's just as economically developed and diverse as any western country, but the culture is completely different. I think westerners tend to conflate cultural differences with colonial views of progress. Comparing the cultures of, say, France and Nigeria isn't an apples to apples comparison. I like situations where you can control for everything but culture. Star Trek is good because, with well defined exceptions like Bajor, there isn't colonial baggage that tilts the scales.

Sooo, with that out of the way:

**Best Cultures**

Klingons - I would have made the same argument about them as /u/theworldtheworld based on TNG, but DS9 fleshed out Klingon society so well. We meet so many different shades of Klingon on DS9, and I could never get enough of it. House of Quark is one of my favourite episodes of the entire Trek canon. 

My struggle with the Klingons was always about how they progressed technologically when glory in battle is held in such high regard. There doesn't seem to be much honour for the engineers and scientists of their world. The few we meet in the Trek universe are swimming against the tide. 

Romulans - I still don't think we have a solid picture of what Romulan culture is. I think that's a shame. Their passionate ying to the Vulcan yang could be such a deep vein of story development, but showrunners never quite dive in. I also feel like they took much of the cultural potential of the Romulans and grafted them on to the Cardassians for DS9. I never quite understood why we needed a whole new power in the ST universe when there was still so much about the Romulans to explore. They could be the villains of DS9 without losing anything.

The El-Aurians - Guinan's species' ability to perceive beyond linear time always fascinated me.

The Founders - There is of course a lot I find problematic about them, but I also darkly admire the fact that they were able to fashion a civilization in which they were gods. I always loved the line from the Vorta, ""what's the point of being a god if you have no one to worship you?"" (I probably got that wrong)

**Worst Cultures**

Ferengi - I love Quark, but give me something more than a society that is a stand in for 19th century western capitalism.

Trill - Two dimensional and with nowhere to go to add depth.

**Wasted Potential**

Q - I want to know more about how the Q evolved to become what they are. In the TNG finale we get a hint at the fact that the Q got to where they are by learning to understand what lies beyond our linear existence. I feel like there's a lot more there to tap into.","StarTrekViewingParty",2,0,0,2016-08-31 01:48:56

"169","I don't know about NJ Transit specifically, but certainly on many inter-city routes, for example Albany-NYC, passenger travel times were better in the 1930s than they are now. 

This has less to do with technology and more to do with the fact that in those days, the railroad companies ran their own passenger services on their own lines. Since Amtrak was created, because air travel made passenger trains unprofitable for the railroads, you now have a publicly run passenger service running trains on lines that are privately owned by companies that primarily move freight. Freight trains run much slower but still get priority. So passenger trains get stuck behind slower trains, or get shunted to the side so the railroad company can keep its schedule.

There have been several measures to address the issue, but the same basic issue still persists.","AskHistorians",4,0,0,2016-08-24 04:27:26

We're programmed to think that marriage is an end in itself, something we should all aspire to in life. That leads to many people settling for less than the ideal so they can check that box. This is the path you are on.

That's not what marriage should be about. Marriage should be a really rare thing that you only do when you no without a shadow of a doubt that this is someone who you want around for the rest of your life, and you're equally sure they see the same thing in you. Otherwise you're signing up for a life of disappointment. And this is your only life. The time you devote to this man, you won't get it back if you marry him.

Again, I'm so sorry. I know this is hard and painful. But ending it now will help you find happiness later. It leaves you open to finding someone who really truly wants to spend their lives with you. And if that doesn't happen, you'll still be better off focusing on building a life of your own that includes all the things you want, rather than spending it feeling like you're someone's safety net.

You deserve much better.

"187","The fact that your aunt almost immediately asked for your address is a HUGE red flag. If these people were seeking a healthy interaction with you, they would not push so hard so fast.

Just want to echo what others have said. The fact that you can't imagine turning your back on your siblings suggests your parents have raised you in a healthy and loving home. Knowing very little else about your situation, that makes me inclined to trust them. 

Just remember that for your whole life, it has been easier for your parents to say your mom's family was dead (or whatever), probably because you wouldn't have been able to understand what was happening. They may not fully appreciate that you're old enough to hear it now. So yes, ask them, but be gentle about it. Let them know you trust them, you'll do what they say. But say also that you're not a little kid any more and you would just like to understand. And lastly, don't insist. Just say that when they're ready to tell you (and your siblings?), you'd like to hear it. Remember that it may be very painful for your mother to talk about. Talking to them about it in a mature and respectful way will help show them that you're ready to hear about this.

My mother had a really unhealthy relationship with pretty much everyone in her family (siblings, parents, an estranged daughter I didn't know about until I was 17), but she couldn't set good boundaries. She died about 6 years ago, and after it fell to me to deal with them, I quickly realized how awful they were (I had some sense before but it didn't really affect me). I am now no longer on speaking terms with any of them, and my life is better for it.

"188","I'm going to lay off the judgement based on your edit. Thank you for finally registering what's really going on here. Please remember your ex-husband has no de facto right to be in his kids lives. Custody agreements aside, he has to earn a place in their lives, like all parents (including you). 

If it hasn't been said elsewhere, please recognize that Grace is being fiercely protective of her brother because she doesn't see anyone else doing it. I'm not saying spitting on her teacher was okay, but it tells me that she has become almost animalistic in her protectiveness of him. And I don't blame her. That's supposed to be your job.

As for Dave, putting aside whether you should be married to him or not, you need to set some boundaries with him. If you want to live with him, fine, but there is no basis for giving him ANY input into your children's lives. None. Zero. If he doesn't want to make any effort to form a bond with them, then you need to tell him that you don't want to hear anything about your kids from him. He can focus on your relationship, and you deal with the kids. If he complains that's not fair, given that he's supporting your family, tough. He knew that going in. These are his choices.

Yes, you need therapy. And Grace needs therapy. And Drew needs therapy. And the three of you need family therapy (your husband has no role to play in that unless he decides he wants to make some effort with your kids).

Finally, recognize that Grace does not need to be treated like a child. She has been the adult in the family for god knows how long now. She absolutely should have some boundaries around not being physically violent towards others, but beyond that, she can look after herself. If anything, you should be asking her what should be happening next. The way to mend fences with her, after apologizing, is to make her a full participant in family decision making. She's earned it.

"190","So I don't mean this in a confrontational way, but my first piece of advice is to maybe get over yourself a bit? A few things:

She's allowed to have enjoyed sex before she met you. And is allowed to look back fondly at that. What would be the difference between her getting off to the memory of hot sex she had with her ex and watching the video? If you came in and saw her masturbating without any video, would you have cared? Would you have asked what/who she was thinking about? You don't own her mind.

Now consider what is going on in her head. She's getting older, this guy is telling her about how her modelling window is closing. One way for her to hear this is ""soon no one will find you beautiful any more."" If she is someone who has traded on her beauty in the past (and if she had a career in modelling, safe to say that she did), then the entire way she thinks about herself could be feeling threatened. It's possible that she may think if she's not beautiful enough to model, she doesn't have much else to offer.

So, she's feeling insecure, questioning her worth, and she wants to remember a time when she felt beautiful, wanted, desired. She's scared it's slipping away, so she decides to relive that time by going and looking back at this video. Maybe she didn't even start off wanting to masturbate; she just wanted to see herself at the height of her desirability, and got carried away. You might ask, why did it have to be with him? Maybe you feel like you've made her feel desired. Well, if he photographed her in the past, it was his job to make her look desirable. It makes a lot of sense that that would be tied up with their sex life in her mind.

I get it; we all want to think we're everything our partner needs. But our partners are layered complicated people with their own insecurities and histories that didn't always include us. Sometimes we just need to get over ourselves.

The way you describe how she looked when you found her...totally lost in it, eyes rolled back...that sounds like someone who was tapping into a deep emotional place.

So, what to do about it? Talk to her, but I strongly urge you not to make it about yourself, or any ""betrayal"". Ask her what led up to it. Ask her what she's been feeling. Get over any idea that this is about you. Or put it aside for now. It's fair to say that Jacob may have been trying to tap into her insecurities this way. He's probably not a healthy person for her to interact with. But when you talk to her, again, don't make it about him being a threat to you, make it about him making her feel badly about who she is now. 

tl;dr What she needs is for you to help her see her worth and her value beyond her good looks. The LAST thing she needs is for you to make this about some non-existent betrayal. Man up, put aside your insecurities, and help her through this.","relationships",0,1,0,2016-08-08 07:25:44

If you can't (for legal reasons or whatever) kick him out of your place, find another place to stay. If you can, change the locks when he's out and leave his stuff on the front step. If you're concerned for your physical safety, see if you can have other men his size there when you expect him to get home.

Barclay obviously suffers from some kind of anxiety disorder, which is incredibly common part of our modern world. I think the whole point of Barclay's presence in the ST universe is to demonstrate that mental health is still an issue in the distant future, and more importantly, that we shouldn't dismiss the contributions that people who struggle with mental health challenges. The first time we meet him, every one is trying to get rid of him; a typical 20th century reaction to someone with a mental health problem. It takes Capt. Picard stepping in to say that's not an acceptable way to treat people. (By the way, it's is regrettably ironic to see Geordi advocating for tossing him aside, given that without help, his ability to contribute  to society as a blind man would probably have dismissed as well.)

Throughout his appearance in the show, we see that when people make the smallest effort to engage him, Barclay makes positive contributions. He helps solve the crisis in the Neterprise the first time we meet him. 

He actually played no part in his take over by the Cytherians. And it was Geordi (hey look another fuck up by a senior officer) who made Moriarty sentient, not Barclay.

1) What would be different, in the day-to-day sense of your marriage, if both of you were openly in love with each other.

If so, ask yourself what is really missing from your marriage right now without these feelings being expressed.

2) What is actually the downside of being honest about how you feel? The important part is your expectation in being honest with her. Do you need anything back from her? Do you need her to be in love with you as well? If not, it's very possible you can tell her how you feel, and she can acknowledge it and you can go on as you have been. Just because she isn't ""the kind of person to fall in love or have deep feelings for partners"", it doesn't mean she thinks you should have the same attitude.

If you have had good communication with your wife since the separation than she has had a chance to get a sense of whether or not you've changed to a sufficient degree, and has decided it's not enough.

Despite the cap, the fact that the NBA has max values you can sign a player for means you can collect superstars if you can move money around. And with 2/3 stars, you're a championship contender. 

But in baseball, the fact that players have a fully open market once they hit free agency makes that challenging. If Harper, Trout, and Kershaw were all free agents next year, the three combined would probably make more than $100 Million per year. Even without a salary cap, no team in the current market would devote that much money to only three players when they need to also pay 22 other players.

"239","The Kobayashi Maru and the test Wesley went through were about separate things. KM is how any cadet in Starfleet deals with a no-win situation, which is an inevitable circumstance when you're in command. 

Wesley's test was tailored to a specific trauma about the death of his father. He needed to understand that his father died because Capt. Picard made a choice, and he was afraid that if put in that same position, he wouldn't be able to make the same choice.

But as to the question of whether the Kobayashi Maru stuck around for a long time...my bet is that these types of tests would evolve significantly with the introduction of the holodeck. The test that Cllr. Troi underwent when she was going through officer training is a good example. It was a no-win scenario (though unlike KM, there was a correct solution), but the holodeck allowed the test to be tailored to people and circumstances she would be familiar with. For instance, the scenario could involve her ordering a friend to his death, which she would find particularly hard.","DaystromInstitute",3,0,0,2016-05-26 01:22:56

"252","Will: Bautista is angry about the Jays not thinking he's worth what he's asking, hits 50 homers, carries them through the playoffs like he did last year, and signs a $150M contract with the Dbacks . (I'm actually glad the contract thing has played out like it has so far. Bautista is SOO good when he's angry)

Also, the offence will do what it does, the pitching will be solid enough to keep them in games, they have no defensive holes (as long as Chris Colabello never goes near left field), and the bullpen won't give away nearly as many games as it did in the first half of last year (they lost something like 14 games in late innings last year before they figured out their bullpen rotation).

Oh, and because Troy Tulowitzki plays for the Toronto Blue Jays. And he is like their fourth or fifth best hitter. I also think you can budget for Tulo to miss 30ish games without missing a beat. He'll be amazing when he's on the field and the Jays have enough offensive and defensive depth to absorb the loss when he's not. 

Won't: Happ and Estrada are more like the 2014 selves than their 2015 selves, a bunch of players go down with injuries, and it turns out there was a reason the Nationals chose Jonathan Papelbon's antics over Drew Storen.

People there really know how to relax and enjoy themselves (Whitey Herzog used to fly the Cardinals into Montreal at the last minute because the players partied so hard in Montreal if they had a night to themselves that they'd be wrecked for the game). It has the best night life of any city in North America. Being able to go to a baseball game outdoors and then hit St. Catherine's Street would bring a lot of people out!

Also, you need to appreciate just how much of a dump Olympic Stadium is. Think of your local high schools football stadium, with the metal bleachers, most basic concessions, and run down washroom. It's fine for local sports of course, but you wouldn't dream of an NFL team playing there or anything. Well, imagine scaling that dodgy stadium up to 60,000 people and actually playing NFL games there. That's what Olympic Stadium is. Plus, as others have pointed out, it's not near anything.

And even with that, when the team was good, they had good attendance and frequent sellouts when they were in a pennant race. So imagine what the interest would be with a halfway decent stadium.

Honestly we wouldn't expect any team that played under the conditions the Expos played in (both on and off the field) to survive today, and they managed for 45 years.","baseball",15,0,0,2016-03-05 05:50:08

You can make a strong case that Don doesn't actually change at the end; he just uses his experience in the ashram to connect with the Coke idea.

Throughout the series, he struggles to connect creatively with the 60s. I view what happens at the end as him finally getting it...professionally. That's what allows him to create the Coke ad.

Don's line in this scene, ""people don't change"" is the central tension of the entire series. My take on the end was that we're lead to believe he has changed, but the Coke ad casts that into doubt. So we still don't know if what Don says in this scene is right or not.

I was going to hold off on reading your book until the off-season (when I read baseball books to stave off the horrible creeping melancholy of not having any baseball to watch), but I gave in and read it on vacation last week and enjoyed it from start to finish.

Anyhoo, the question: Given everything that's happened with the Dodgers front office in the last year, if you had it to do over again, would you have waited another year to write your book?

I ask because one of the conclusions I took from your book was that the new owners realized that just spending as much money as possible isn't a sure-fire way to build a champion, and the team is so clearly trying a different approach with Friedman and Zaidi.
