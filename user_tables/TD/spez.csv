In fact, that's one of the reasons subreddits exist at all in the first place. One of the first subreddits I made was r/politics, and I made it because even though I was interested in the subject, I found I was starting every day pissed off and didn't like it. This was back around 2005, maybe 2006. The front page, which had been mostly programming and internet culture content until then, was being overrun with angry politics. Creating r/politics gave that content a home where it could thrive without drowning out the rest.

I now have a couple of [custom feeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) that I use depending on my mood, and would love to see us invest more in this line of features.","CasualConversation",64,0,0,2019-08-15 07:38:12

It was one upvote for one karma point. That's still the basis, I believe, but just as post and comment scoring have some restrictions to prevent cheating (e.g. IP limits), karma scoring has even more.

The biggest gap between karma scoring and post scoring is we undid a (outdated) restriction on post scoring that is still on karma scoring. u/keysersosa wrote a post about it a couple years ago.

"29","Thank you, Senator.

As it relates to r/the_donald specifically, we watch them closely, and we do our best to hold them to the same standards and policies as we do all communities. Before we action any community, we also speak to moderators regarding rule breaking behaviors. To that end, we have removed a number of their moderators over the years for not moderating to our standards, and we wouldn’t hesitate to do this again, or take additional steps, should their behavior warrant it. While they can be offensive and antagonistic to the rest of Reddit, we have not found them to be in consistent violation of our content policies.

Yes, we do see individual posts and comments that cross the line, but the offending content also gets removed as we ask and expect, and we also take action against those individual users and accounts with suspensions or full bans from the site as appropriate.

I wish there was a solution that was as simple as banning the community—certainly it would make some things easier—but the reality is that banning a large political community that isn’t in violation of our policies would be hugely problematic, not just for Reddit, but for our democracy generally. Political speech is the most protected form of speech in the United States, and we are sensitive to that and take cues from the government when we think about our policies.

I know this isn’t the answer many of you are looking for, but as we continue to deliberate and evolve our thinking, my hope is that you appreciate the complexity of this situation and understand our approach.","politics",-1401,0,0,2019-06-05 00:52:43
"30","&gt;what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles?

Pasting from my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bwpqqi/we_are_us_senator_ron_wyden_and_reddit_ceo_steve/epzexlh/):

Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, we’ve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and we’ve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today. Additionally, we have built tools to help moderators proactively combat community interference (née brigading) that are in alpha testing, and we’ve built a new “reliable reporter” system to surface information to our threat team even quicker.

&gt;Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?

Yes, though detecting and mitigating the impact of bots is a bit of an arms race. As our capabilities get better, the adversary also gets better. 

Detection today is reliant on technical indicators (such as IP) and leveraging our data scientists to detect abnormal behavior.

One common vector of attack is to hack otherwise legitimate dormant or insecure accounts and then use them to manipulate Reddit. Working against that, we have focused on improving account security to prevent malicious bots from taking over these accounts. Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/) for how you can help improve the security of your account

Of course, not all bots are bad bots: r/subredditsimulator, automod, auto crossposting news bots, etc. One option is to ask helpful community bots to self-identify, leaving the potentially malicious bots for us to deal with.","politics",-13,1,0,2019-06-05 00:24:00
"31","&gt;For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions?

Reddit’s greatest strengths are our users and communities, who are our first line of defense. That communities can create their own rules and enforce them and that users can reject content and behaviors through downvotes and social pressure is very powerful.

Using fake news as an example, we think it is problematic for a private company, or even worse, me as an individual, or the government, to decide which news sources are valid and which are not. Communities, however, are free to choose which news sources they accept and reject. In fact, our news communities are among our most aggressively moderated. There is a huge difference between a private company deciding what is and isn’t news vs our users doing the same thing.

That said, we do our best to fight coordinated or inauthentic content, working on both the policy and product fronts to prevent our voting systems from being abused while at the same time increasing the sophistication of community governance, and banning / limiting users that try to manipulate our systems and communities.","politics",-25,0,0,2019-06-05 00:09:43

"59","A couple years ago, I was wondering this exact question.

Ups and downs are something we've had since *nearly* the first version of Reddit (but not the very first version: early iterations had words instead of arrows, but words were too subjective and restrictive).

Anyway... a couple years ago I considered the idea that downvotes were purely destructive, and that we'd be better off without them. My reasoning was that it feels bad to receive downvotes, and getting downvoted is an especially poor experience if you're a new user. If our goal is to make Reddit more welcoming and accessible, we were working against ourselves. Also, downvotes are weaponized by users and communities to harass and brigade, further compounding the problem.

However, despite their flaws, downvotes are a critical tool for communities to develop and maintain their voice, and without them we couldn't scale moderation. There are only so many moderators and far fewer admins, and by allowing community members to moderate content in a lightweight way, they can develop their own identities and voice and keep out the junk (most of it at least).

I know downvotes have their flaws, but they've been critical to growth of every large subreddit, making addressing their flaws supremely important. Improving downvotes is one of our current initiatives, and hopefully you'll feel the changes in the coming weeks if you haven't felt them already.","TheoryOfReddit",38,0,0,2019-02-12 09:30:27

"65","Sure, I can see how one would interpret it that way. Let me provide another way of looking at things:

Whether in an AMA or interview or in person, not only am I happy to answer hard questions, I generally look forward to it. It's in my nature to do so, often to my own detriment ([example](https://new.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/dx5go62/)), but I do look for questions that meet two criteria: questions that are asked politely, and asked in a manner that suggests the questioner will actually attempt to listen to my response (even if we have zero chance of agreeing).

In my AMA yesterday, I didn't see much of either, especially as it relates to r/the_donald. I did attempt to leave a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75s1o8/) [responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75wos8/) on the topic, and I have attempted to other respond many times in the past, but since my answer is never ""yep, they're getting banned,"" I end up buried. So it goes.

It's really isn't my intention to ignore people. I'll probably do another AMA in the near future, and if someone wants to ask simply ""why don't you ban r/the_donald?"" I'll do my best to answer honestly and politely, though my answer will probably look a lot like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7u2zpi/not_my_first_could_be_my_last_state_of_the/dth6eq9/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=announcements).

The quarantine feature is now much more flexible, allowing us to apply a variety of sanctions to a community, including an interstitial page, which is what is applied to WPD.

While we do believe a warning page is appropriate for WPD as the content there can be quite disturbing, I do regret lumping them in with the other toxic communities because the mods at WPD have been completely collaborative with us.

3) Historically it has been optional, and it technically still is, though we're reconsidering it. While I was the original proponent of no-emails, we've found it to be problematic for a couple of reasons over the years: lost account passwords take time for our team to resolve, no emails makes tracking abuse more difficult, and there's more pressure than ever to fight such abuse, and it's generally helpful to be able to reach users where they are with important notifications.

We know these kinds of accounts have been a problem, and they’re not easy for moderators to deal with alone. We’ve talked a bit elsewhere about a relatively new team we’ve spun up to deal with content manipulation. While their focus has been largely on political manipulation, many of the same tools and methods they’re developing are also effective against these kinds of spam networks. As those things work their way into production, we hope you’ll see far less of these accounts in your subreddits.

One of the specific focuses of the Anti-Evil team going forward is to ""reduce janitorial work"" for our team and moderators alike.

Similarly, improved tools that don't require as much technical knowledge are on the roadmap.","announcements",1137,0,0,2018-10-05 01:57:17

The quarantine feature is now much more flexible, allowing us to apply a variety of sanctions to a community, including an interstitial page, which is what is applied to WPD.

While we do believe a warning page is appropriate for WPD as the content there can be quite disturbing, I do regret lumping them in with the other toxic communities because the mods at WPD have been completely collaborative with us.

In August, we wrote a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/) regarding an Iranian attempt at manipulation.

A couple weeks ago, we saw another round of posts centered around usareally.com, which is now banned. What we found in this case was that the users behind it were indeed of Russian origin, though we have no technical evidence that they are affiliated with the IRA. Similar to the IRA's previous efforts, this group's efforts were largely not effective: They submitted 953 posts to 130 different communities. Of the 264 posts submitted to r/the_donald, only one made it into the top 100, and 0 made it into the top 25.

We have a team dedicated to finding and preventing coordinated behavior to manipulate Reddit. The first question whenever we find anything is, ""what could we have done to find this sooner?"" In this case, we would have liked to have caught and banned the domains sooner because they were behaving in a spammy matter, and have adjusted our processes to do so going forward.

"102","The decision for r/science to no longer host AMAs is disappointing, and blaming us at Reddit is counterproductive.

u/nallen, having met you personally a number of times and after personally trying to work through this issue with you over the past months, I'm disappointed you've taken this approach to mislead your community about what's going on.

So here's what's really going on:

**How it used to work**

r/science used to be a default community, which means it was one of one hundred communities that made up the front page of Reddit for most of 2011–2016. As a result, r/science and the other defaults had high visibility at the expense of non\-default communities.

r/science used to promote AMAs by removing other more popular posts so that the AMA could be top of r/science without the votes. This, combined with being a default community, sent a lot of traffic to these AMAs.

**How it works today**

We replaced the defaults with r/popular, which is basically a SFW version of r/all. This puts all communities on an equal footing.

We don't allow the post manipulation for obvious reasons. Here is a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/77o0wm/friday_discussion_thread_what_unique_challenges/donto0j/?context=3) we had with u/nallen on this topic months ago.

We are indeed testing new sorting algorithms, but if anything they should help communities like r/science get more visibility. One of our engineers recently wrote a [pretty good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/8kf5wm/reddits_first_pass_ranker/) about it.

**Going forward**

Regardless of u/nallen's decision, we will continue to work to improve our onboarding and sorting so that users get to see more of what they love, and we have in mind some specific features that will help promote ""event"" posts \(AMAs, game threads, episode threads\) in the future.","science",1605,0,0,2018-05-19 23:33:51
"103","You can use the old layout indefinitely. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) and uncheck ""use the redesign as my default experience."" I know the prefs page is a bit of a mess. It's one of the things we're rebuilding in the redesign. We have no plans to turn off old.reddit.com. 

As for why:

1. New tech stack. The existing codebase is nearly impossible to build in. The redesign gives us a modern platform in which to develop. In the redesign we're able to ship lots of stuff every week. [Here's our most recent update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8jgu1q/51518_release_notes_inbox_count_post_flair/)
2. Easier to use. r2, our name for the legacy site, is quite difficult to grok. We see and lose a lot of potential users every day because they don't know wtf Reddit is. Engagement in our native apps is 2–5x higher even though the content is identical. Part of this is due to the phone form factor, but part of this is do to a more visceral UI.
3. Adapt Reddit to its content. When r2 was built, Reddit was 100&amp;#37; outbound links and self\-posts. Today, we have a lot more media and have plans to add more post types. The UI should support that.
4. Ads. In\-feed ads are what advertisers want to buy. Yes, they're in\-feed, which I know isn't popular, but it also means our top post is an organic post now instead of an ad. We will continue to iterate on the styling.
5. Perception. We will no longer have to explain our ancient UI to potential partners, which really was quite a hurdle. Reddit being synonymous with ""old and difficult to use"" isn't good for business.
6. Portable styles. I know there's a lot of heat around this one as well, but structured styles allow community styling to work across platforms, which is important given the majority of our traffic today is mobile. It also makes community styling easier and therefore more accessible to more communities.

We've still got a lot to do, but we started rolling it out because we decided it was good enough to get going, and if we waited until it was perfect, we'd never ship. Plus, having the user base providing constant ""feedback"" is highly motivating to the team.

Personally, I've switched my desktop Reddit\-ing to the redesign and am pretty happy. I'd encourage folks to give it a try. If you don't like it, opt\-out and hopefully check back in in a month. It's updating rapidly.","TheoryOfReddit",62,0,0,2018-05-19 02:22:10

"131","**Update (4/12):** In the heat of a live AMA, I don’t always find the right words to express what I mean.  I decided to answer this direct question knowing it would be a difficult one because it comes up on Reddit quite a bit. I’d like to add more nuance to my answer:

While the words and expressions you refer to aren’t explicitly forbidden, the behaviors they often lead to are. 

To be perfectly clear, while racism itself isn’t against the rules, it’s not welcome here. I try to stay neutral on most political topics, but this isn’t one of them.

I believe the best defense against racism and other repugnant views, both on Reddit and in the world, is instead of trying to control what people can and cannot say through rules, is to repudiate these views in a free conversation, and empower our communities to do so on Reddit.

When it comes to enforcement, we separate behavior from beliefs. We cannot control people’s beliefs, but we can police their behaviors. As it happens, communities dedicated racist beliefs end up banned for violating rules we do have around harassment, bullying, and violence.

There exist repugnant views in the world. As a result, these views may also exist on Reddit. I don’t want them to exist on Reddit any more than I want them to exist in the world, but I believe that presenting a sanitized view of humanity does us all a disservice. It’s up to all of us to reject these views.

These are complicated issues, and we may not always agree, but I am listening to your responses, and I do appreciate your perspectives. Our policies have changed a lot over the years, and will continue to evolve into the future. Thank you.

**Original response:**

It's not. On Reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs. This means on Reddit there will be people with beliefs different from your own, sometimes extremely so. When users actions conflict with our content policies, we take action.

Our approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves. Many communities have rules around speech that are more restrictive than our own, and we fully support those rules.","announcements",-1341,0,0,2018-04-11 05:54:31

"153","This post is really the first time we've said anything of consequence regarding Russia, and we wanted to share it with you, the community, first.

&gt; A lot of words were used, but very little was said.

Let me try again, with at least fewer words, but hopefully a little more clearly as well.

1. In regards to ads, we haven't seen much on Reddit. It's been an issue elsewhere online, but not a factor on Reddit. We'll stay vigilant going forward.

2. As it relates to actual Russia accounts on Reddit. We have found a few hundred accounts through a variety of means. The vast majority of these accounts were rejected by our communities back in 2015–2016 before Russia was even a topic of conversation. Our spam filters, community rules against self-promotion, and moderators banned nearly all of them. I don't want to give the impression the work stops there. That's what we've seen so far, and we're still looking deeply.

3. As for propaganda (Russian or otherwise, and there was plenty of American propaganda to go around) hosted elsewhere that was amplified by real organic users, we’ve seen a lot of that, both on Reddit and elsewhere. Reddit is a huge place with thousands of communities and opinions. That's both what makes us special and what creates conflict. That's not to say there isn't plenty of work for us: we will continue to invest in better tooling, both for our internal teams and for moderators; we'll continue to ensure our voting systems aren't being manipulated; and we'll continue grow our teams so we can enforce our policies at scale.

"155","Point taken. Didn't mean to mislead. I was referring to ads bought directly on Reddit either through our sales team or ads.reddit.com.

We do also run programmatic ads that are bought through ad networks that include Reddit. These don't go through the same approval process, but they're also not specific to Reddit. We have had occasional problems in the past where an ad with sound or video sneaks through, usually when an ad is misclassified as non-video. These issues are uncommon, and we've basically eliminated them in the last year.","announcements",-717,0,0,2018-03-06 09:46:12
"156","We don’t take banning subs lightly. Each sub is reviewed by a human—and in some cases, a team of humans—before it is banned for a content policy violation. In cases where a sub’s sole purpose is in direct violation of our policies (i.e. sharing of involuntary porn), we will ban a sub outright. But generally before banning, we attempt to work with the mods to clarify our expectations and policies regarding what content is welcome.

Communities do evolve over time, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively, so we do need to re-review communities from time to time, which is what's going on in this case. Revenue isn't a factor.","announcements",1070,0,0,2018-03-06 05:16:11

"219","Ah, well let me share another perspective.

A really important target user of this feature is the original content creator. Back in the beginning, we created the 1-in-10 rule, which meant that you were only allowed to submit 1-in-10 pieces of content from the same domain. This was in response to folks who would show up on Reddit, not know their way around, and submit every piece of content from their blog. We only had one community then, and this behavior was considered rude at best, and spam at worst. Keep in mind we had only links back then as well.

Skip ahead to today, we have many thousands of communities, proper spam prevention, and a massive userbase to curate good content. More than 60% of the content on Reddit exists in self posts. The users who create original, unique, relevant content off-site would be huge on Reddit if their content was in text posts hosted on Reddit instead. The only difference is in hosting. Profile pages are intended to be hosting for these users.

I was talking to a friend the other night who writes a blog dedicated to news for our neighborhood. It's great content, it would be right at home in a couple of places on Reddit. She is a writer, not a social media expert. I think it's unfair that in addition to creating good content we expect her to source nine other things from around the web so her stuff will be seen by the audience that will probably like it (I'm speaking on behalf of these communities. I'm a part of them). With new profile pages, she can submit her stuff to her profile, and if the relevant communities like it, they can crosspost it in. If they don't, she can build her own following on her profile. The end result is the can write and post without being treated like a spammer.

Reddit itself is more resilient than other places online because our community is generally pretty good at sniffing out bullshit, and structure of our site means any one viewpoint isn't seen and accepted by everyone.

The short answer is: there was some good feedback in that thread, but also plenty that isn't super relevant. With profile pages in particular, I think showing will be better than telling. It's going to take some time for it to be a cohesive product.

The feedback was received, and I think when the dust settles it'll be received much better.

Update: I realize I didn't actually give you a a product update. Profile pages as a feature are about 25% complete. We have a lightly redesigned page (temporary) and personal subreddits. This gives people a place to post, but not much incentive to do so. What we're missing that we believe makes this feature more cohesive are privacy controls, smart comment display (most reddit original content are in comments), and x-posting as a first-class feature (e.g. u/shitty_watercolour can post to his profile and he or others can x-post in r/comics or r/funny or whatever).

Not always. It takes time to get these things right, which is why we're moving slowly. We received a lot of feedback, some of which was actionable (e.g. more privacy controls), some of which isn't useful (e.g. you're turning in Facebook!).

The reality is the feature isn't yet cohesive, so much of the user feedback lacks context.

The entire company is 230 people, with the T&amp;S team being significantly smaller, so we can't possible respond to every one of them. The reports are valuable, however.

When it comes to privacy, I do believe there is some amount of personal responsibility and education required, but we try to be helpful where we can.","announcements",517,0,0,2017-04-04 04:51:09

"368","Sure. We can always improve, but here are a few examples:

* We're dialing up our presence on r/modsupport
* Our goal is to keep ticket response times under 12 hours (our average is less than this)
* We just released the first version of [mod tools for mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/60w4x6/mod_tools_available_in_the_mobile_apps/)
* For big site features, e.g. the redesign, subreddit rules, post-to-profile, we work closely with mods during development

"369","&gt; Emergency Disclosure Requests can be made to Reddit to compel us to disclose user account information in certain circumstances when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. When notified of a potential emergency situation by law enforcement, we require law enforcement to provide enough information to satisfy Reddit that the standard is met, and further require that the law enforcement officer certify the request in writing.","announcements",1032,0,0,2017-04-04 04:35:05

"379","&gt; you are responsible for reporting it to the appropriate authorities?

It depends on the nature of the request. For something like child pornography, yes, we have to report. For something like how to make drugs, we don't. It doesn't mean we won't see a subpoena, though.

&gt; If so, how do you reduce false positives? If not, how do you handle such a large load?

It's a lot of work, to be honest. We don't automatically do anything in this area. If it involves turning over information or removing content, we consider carefully.","announcements",3399,0,0,2017-04-04 04:06:43

"385","Thanks for your thoughts. While the scenario you paint is possible, I think it's the bleakest possible outcome, and one nobody wants to see happen. We still have plenty of work to do, and the feature will continue to evolve as we roll it out.

Instead of the total destruction of Reddit, what we'd like to accomplish is to make it easier for folks to find a place to share on Reddit.

Remember that time when u/GovSchwarzenegger wrote an op-ed for Reddit about marriage equality and then was immediately banned? That is so silly. Reddit is a place to share, discuss, and express yourself, and you should be able to do so without fear of immediately getting crushed.","announcements",-871,0,0,2017-03-22 02:56:49
"386","&gt; you're claiming setting up a subreddit with posting privileges restricted to yourself is hard

It's totally hard, which is why few people do it. Yes, we do have other problems, including a clunky UI around some of this stuff, which we're working on.","announcements",-128,0,0,2017-03-22 02:34:44

"388","What we really want to see is for users who have things to share, they have a place to put it. Even I have this problem. I often have ideas for a post, but don't know which community I should submit it to. r/announcements, my main home, probably isn't appropriate. Even if I know the right community, I may not know the community norms and rules. This gives me a place to put my thoughts without worry that I'm going to get insta-banned. If someone decides it's appropriate for their community, they can x-post it.","announcements",-76,0,0,2017-03-22 02:28:42

"391","&gt; Will you counteract SEO spam posted on user's profiles at all?

We'll continue to fight spam wherever it is. We have made a lot of progress in the last year, reducing spam reports by over 90%. The vast majority of spam is not caught by automod or humans.

&gt; How will I be able to find OC creators if not by their real name?

It's important to us that Reddit is useable without real names. Folks can choose to disclose this if they want, of course.

As for discoverability, a user's posts could be x-posted elsewhere, which is how Reddit works today, or the user may have their own community, which a handful already do now.

&gt; Will personal posts be included in the reddit-wide search (please no)?

Search is getting a complete overhaul at the moment, so this will likely be an option.

&gt; Will we be able to differentiate between profile and subreddit posts i.e. will Toolbox still be able to compile an accurate report of submitted domain percentages (only subreddit posts)?

That's up the toolbox devs, but it should be apparent which subreddits belong to a user and which are traditional communities.
